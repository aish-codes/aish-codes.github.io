      - Started my journey to code with R. I'm skilled at R programming and can do data analysis, machine learning and automation
  - **Python**
      - Proficient at writing Python code for data analysis, machine learning, deep learning and automation. Higher adoption and support  of Python over R for deep learning and machine learning tasks made me learn Python  
  - **SQL**
      - Adept at writing SQL queries and stored procedures with a little help from GPT ðŸ˜‹

- **Data Processing:** 
  - **MS Excel** 
      - Can do most stuff but don't ask me about the macros
  - **Alteryx Expert**
      - I can create complex Alteryx Macros, Alteryx Apps and publish them over gallery. Bascially a wizard with Alteryx

- **Database:** 
  - **SQL**
      - I have worked on plenty of projects relating to SQL which has made me proficient in writing SQL queries & stored procedures
  - **Snowflake**
      - Knowledgable about Snowflake databases and still learning
  - **MS Access**
      - Worked on a project where I had to convert the MS Access dashboard to a R Shiny dashboard which gave me plenty of insights about the workings of MS Access

- **Data Visualization:** 
  - **R Shiny**
      - I have experience of building complex R Shiny dashboards. Don't believe me? Click at this link  
  - **PowerBI**
      - Dashboarding has been an integral part of my learning curve at EY GDS and IMO there's nothing easier to implement dashboards than PBI

- **Deep Learning & Gen AI:** 
  - **Machine Learning** 
      - Adept at deploying machine learning solutions. For organisations, I've worked on solutions relating to Market Mix Modelling, Sales Forecasting, Healthcare Planning & Text Analytics 
  - **Neural Networks**
      - Have an in-depth understanding of RNNs, CNNs & experience of working on neural networks (thanks to Karpathy) for tasks relating to Image Processing & Natural Language Processing
  - **LLMs**
      - Building RAG based solutions has been the flavor for every organisation in 2023-24 and yes I did that too. The solution encompassed a retrieval memory alongside function calling of financial APIs. I was responsible for integrating the APIs and building the agent which based its action on user input. I'm well versed with Langchain, Langsmith and Azure environment for solution deployment

- **Cloud Computing:** 
  - **Azure DevOps**
    - Skilled in deploying continuous integration and development (CI/CD) pipelines. Experienced in managing code repositories, build processed and automated deployments
  - **Azure AI**
    - Proficient in leveraging Azure AI services for building and deploying machine learning models & AI applications

- **Version Control:** 
  - **Git**

- **MS Power Platforms:** 
  - **PowerBI**
  - **Power Automate**
  - **Power Apps**

## <span style="color:#000080">Certifications</span>
  - I will add more certifications to my credentials going forward. Meanwhile the below are the courses that have shaped my journey in Data Science

  - **Linear Algebra Lectures by Rachel Howard**
  - **Neural Networks by Andrej Karpathy**
  - **CS 25 by Stanford**

## <span style="color:#000080">Work Experience</span>
- **To The New Digital : 2015 Apr - 2015 Nov**
  - Started my work journey in non-tech role with my work involving analyzing social media data, manually tagging sentiments and assisting in creation of Powerpoint Reports for digital consultations   
- **Grapes Digital : 2016 May - 2017 Oct**
  - Here I pivoted to a role where I was mainly working on presentations and reports for business development. Yes I worked as a **sales guy !**
  Still did not code anything ðŸ™„
- **GroupM : 2017 Nov - 2020 Nov**
  - This is the place where I got introduced to analytics and R programming. I learnt R programming, data processing on Alteryx & SQL on the job. In hindsight this proved to be the pivotal moment in my data science journey 
- **EY GDS : 2020 Dec - Now** 
  - The EY experience has pushed me to learn and pick up new technologies where I've been able to upskill myself on most of the above mentioned skills.
