  - **Python**
      - Proficient at writing Python code for data analysis, machine learning, deep learning and automation. Higher adoption and support  of Python over R for deep learning and machine learning tasks made me learn Python  
  - **SQL**
      - Adept at writing SQL queries and stored procedures with a little help from GPT ðŸ˜‹

- **Data Processing:** 
  - **MS Excel** 
      - Can do most stuff but don't ask me about the macros !
  - **Alteryx Expert**
      - I can create complex Alteryx Macros, Alteryx Apps and publish them over gallery. Bascially a wizard with Alteryx !

  - **SQL**
      - I have worked on plenty of projects relating to SQL which has made me proficient in writing SQL queries & stored procedures
  - **Snowflake**
      - Knowledgable about Snowflake databases and still learning
  - **MS Access**
      - Worked on a project where I had to convert the MS Access dashboard to a R Shiny dashboard which gave me plenty of insights about the workings of MS Access

- **Data Visualization:** 
  - **R Shiny**
      - I have experience of building complex R Shiny dashboards. Don't believe me? Click at this link  
  - **PowerBI**
      - Dashboarding has been an integral part of my learning curve at EY GDS and IMO there's nothing easier to implement dashboards than PBI

- **Deep Learning & Gen AI:** 
  - **Machine Learning** 
      - Adept at deploying machine learning solutions. For organisations, I've worked on solutions relating to Market Mix Modelling, Sales Forecasting, Healthcare Planning & Text Analytics 
  - **Neural Networks**
      Have an in-depth understanding of RNNs, CNNs & experience of working on neural networks (thanks to Karpathy) for tasks relating to Image Processing & Natural Language Processing
  - **LLMs**
      - Building RAG based solutions has been the flavor for every organisation in 2023-24 and yes I did that too. The solution encompassed a retrieval memory alongside function calling of financial APIs. I was responsible for integrating the APIs and building the agent which based its action on user input. I'm well versed with Langchain, Langsmith and Azure environment for solution deployment

- **Cloud Computing:** 
  - **Azure DevOps**
    - Skilled in deploying continuous integration and development (CI/CD) pipelines. Experienced in managing code repositories, build processed and automated deployments
